# ðŸŽ¯ Playwright Practice Project â€” Level 1: Setup & Basics

Welcome to **Level 2** of my Playwright Practice Projects!  
This branch focuses on building **reusable and maintainable test structures** using **abstractions, fixtures, and handling more complex scenarios**.  

---

## ðŸ§  Objective

- Implement **test abstractions** for reusability  
- Use **fixtures** for setup and teardown (e.g., login, test data)  
- Write **complex end-to-end test scenarios** with multiple steps  
- Continue leveraging **GitHub Copilot** for AI-assisted code suggestions  

---

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Playwright** | End-to-end automation testing framework |
| **TypeScript** | Strongly typed language for scalable test code |
| **Node.js** | Runtime environment for running Playwright |
| **VS Code + GitHub Copilot** | AI-assisted code suggestions and refactoring |

## ðŸ§ª What This Level Covers

- âœ… Creating **helper functions and page abstractions** 
- âœ… Creating **environment file,installing dotenv and importing dotenv in playwright.config.ts**   
- âœ… Using **fixtures** for common setup (login, test data, environment setup)  
- âœ… Handling **complex user workflows** with multiple steps  
- âœ… Improved **test maintainability** with reusable components
